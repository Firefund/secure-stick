Ideally this is the User eXperience (UX) for an activist:

1. Insert the USB into a computer
2. Create a long passphrase for encrypting the USB device
3. Enter username, password and email for either the noblog or riseup email account
4. That's it! Now the the activist can just insert the usb into a computer, reboot or turn on the computer
and then type in the long passphrase to decrypt the device. Everything should be setup to read and write encrypted emails.
