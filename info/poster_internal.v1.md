Help us be safer with your old USB stick
===============================

We always make the choice to put ourself in harms way, when we go to the front lines of state repression. Be it on the street of Paris or the refugee camps around Europe. But there can be an inescapable danger, in just planning and communicating with our comrades. Information like, emails, are stored indefinitely by states and can reoccurred in trials or be used to map collectives of people practicing resistance.

But with a little help, we can make organizing and communicating a lot safer for us all. We just need your old USB stick (minimum 4GB) and we will turn it into an encrypted communication tool.
